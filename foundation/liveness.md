Liveness Detection consists of two parts:&#x20;

1. **Active Liveness** is authentication that requires movement from the user. For example, head movements, eyes, mouth, expression, and others.&#x20;
2. **Passive Liveness** is authentication without requiring any movement from the user. This authentication detects whether the image/video sent is an image of a real person's face, not from a cellphone screen, paper, or face mask.
